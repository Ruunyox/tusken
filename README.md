# Tusken: a small, readable bitmap font.

### The Font

Tusken is a small bitmap font that is based off of a modified version of artwiz-aleczapka's "lime" font (artwiz-aleczapka.sourceforge.net). Some of the numerals have been modified, and subtle serifs and other embellishments have been added to the alphabet characters.
